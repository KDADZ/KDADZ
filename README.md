## Conflict Plan

### What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?
    - F.U.N. F is for friends who do things together, U is for you and me. N is for anywhere and anytime at all down here at Code Fellows.
    
### What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?
    - 

### How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?
### How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?
### How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

##Communication Plan
Before beginning to tackle the project, determine how your group will communicate with each other. This is not an individual effort. Make sure everyone feels comfortable with the identified methods of speaking up.

Describe at least:

### What hours will you be available to communicate?
### What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?
### How often will you take breaks?
### What is your plan if you start to fall behind?
### How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?
### What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?
### How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?


## Work Plan
Explain your work plan to track whether everyone is contributing equally to all parts of the project, and that each person is working on “meaty” problems. This should prevent “lone wolf” efforts and “siloed” efforts.

NOTE: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

Describe at least:

### How you will identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?
### What project management tool will be used?
