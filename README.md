### Summary of idea.

Jeopardy game with rogue light capabilities in which an individual answers categorial based questions to receive points. They use those points to buy items in the shop for upgrades/perks. The player only has 5 lives to start off with and when they miss a question, they lose a heart. At 0 hp, the character dies and goes into oblivion. If the character gets enough points, they can enter a boss round. If they win, they escape into the virtual world of freedom.
